many a hand has scaled the
grand old face of the plateau
some belong to strangers
and some to folks you know
holy ghosts and talk show
hosts are planted in the sand
to beautify the foothills
and shake the many hands
there's nothing on the top
but a bucket and a mop
and an illustrated
book about birds
you see a lot up there
but don't be scared
who needs action
when you got words
<♪>
finished with the mop
then you can stop
and look at what you've done
the plateau's clean
no dirt to be seen
and the work it took was fun
there's nothing on the top
but a bucket and a mop
and an illustrated
book about birds
you see a lot up there
but don't be scared
who needs action
when you got words
<♪>
many hands began to scan around
for the next plateau
some said it was in greenland
and some in mexico
other decided it was nowhere
except for where they stood
but they were all just guesses
wouldn't help you if they could
